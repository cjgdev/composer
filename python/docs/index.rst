Composer: High-Performance Music Theory Library
===============================================

**Composer** is a sophisticated music theory and composition software system that provides AI-powered musical intelligence. Built in Rust with comprehensive Python bindings, it offers real-time chord analysis, harmonic progression suggestions, and advanced music theory algorithms.

ðŸŽµ **Key Features**
-------------------

* **AI-Powered Chord Suggestions** - Context-aware progression recommendations
* **Advanced Music Theory Analysis** - Roman numeral notation and scale degree analysis  
* **Real-Time Performance** - Optimized algorithms with <1ms chord lookups
* **Comprehensive Chord Support** - Extensions, alterations, inversions, and borrowed harmony
* **Binary Serialization** - Efficient 5-byte chord format with 98.6% compression
* **Machine Learning Ready** - Tokenization and pattern matching for ML applications

ðŸš€ **Quick Start**
------------------

.. code-block:: python

   import composer

   # Create and analyze chords
   chord = composer.Chord(5, 7)  # G7 chord
   scale = composer.ScaleFingerprint.major()
   degrees = composer.get_stable_scale_degrees(chord, scale)
   print(f"G7 contains scale degrees: {degrees}")

   # AI-powered suggestions
   engine = composer.AiEngine()
   engine.initialize(training_patterns)
   suggestions = engine.get_chord_suggestions(progression, context, config)

ðŸŽ¼ **Musical Capabilities**
---------------------------

**Chord Analysis**
   Complete support for triads, sevenths, extensions (9th, 11th, 13th), alterations (â™­5, â™¯9, â™¯11), 
   suspensions, inversions, applied chords, and borrowed harmony.

**Scale Theory**
   Major, minor, modal scales with fingerprint-based analysis. Support for chromatic and 
   diatonic scale relationships.

**Roman Numeral Analysis**
   Automatic generation of Roman numeral notation with figured bass, quality indicators,
   and harmonic function analysis.

**AI-Powered Features**
   Machine learning algorithms for chord progression suggestions, difficulty assessment,
   bass line harmonization, and pattern matching.

ðŸ“Š **Architecture Overview**
----------------------------

Composer follows a **cross-platform monorepo** architecture:

.. code-block:: text

   composer/
   â”œâ”€â”€ rust/                    # High-performance Rust core
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ composer-core/       # Music theory algorithms
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ composer-ai/         # AI-powered features
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ composer-serialization/ # Binary formats
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ composer-ffi/        # Python bindings
   â”œâ”€â”€ python/                  # Python package (you are here)
   â””â”€â”€ wasm/                    # WebAssembly bindings

The Python package provides a high-level, Pythonic interface to the optimized Rust core,
enabling both ease of use and maximum performance.
